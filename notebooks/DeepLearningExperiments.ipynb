Actually, COS is needed for all Watson Studio prohects.\n- **Watson Machine Learning (WML)** which handles sotring the training and experiment information, executing the training runs and experiments, and deploying trained models.\n\nTraining a deep learning neural networks involves the following steps:\n1. Setup COS to define buckets for reading the training data and buckets for writing the training results.\n2. Create one or more training definition which outline the neural network (NN) architecture and the references to the COS bucket containing the input training data and output COS bucket for writing training results.\n3. **Optional** Execute a training run based on the training definition in step 2. This step is optional and only executed to validate the information is set up correctly for training. Practically, data scientists would run experiments with hyper parameter optimization (HPO) which consist of multiple training definitions and multiple parameters to optimize.\n4. Create an experiment definition which would include the training definition in step 2, the COS bucket with input training data, the COS bucket to write the training results, and the optimization configuration parameters such as the optimization algorithm, parameters to vary, and the metrics to consider when comparing alternatives.\n5. Monitor / visualize experiment results which is a critical step to understand the performance of your models.\n\nIn the rest of this notebook, we will go through these steps and discuss the details for each step.\n\n1.

To get that endpoint:\n\n- Navigate to your COS instance on your IBM Cloud account\n- Click on the Endpoint link in the left navigation column\n- Copy the public endpoint corresponding to your COS location. If your location is us-geo, then select the public endpoint for us-geo.\n\nThe service endpoint would look as follows: 'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net'",

Training Definition\nDeep Learning scientist typically run many experiments to optimize various parameters of their deep learning models. \n\nAs described in [Watson Machine Learning Documentation](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_working_with_experiments.html?audience=wdp&context=analytics), an experiment is a logical grouping of one or more training definitions. When an experiment is run, it creates training runs for each training definition that is part of the experiment.\n\nTraining definitions are the organizing principle for using deep learning functions in IBM Watson Machine Learning. A typical scenario might consist of dozens to hundreds of training definitions. Each training definition is defined individually and consists of the following parts: the neural network defined by using one of the supported deep learning frameworks and location of the IBM Cloud Object Storage that contains your data set. \n\nFor more details on training definitions, consult the documentation:\nhttps://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_working_with_training_definitions.html\n\nIn the next section, we will define the training definitions to run. Note that there are some general parameters like model name, description, author, and runtime.\n\nNote the **EXECUTION_COMMAND** which effectively specifies what exactly the model consists of. In this case, the actual neural network being trained is a convolutional neural network (CNN) modeled in the **convolutional_network.py** python script. Note that so far, we've referenced the script but didn't provide it yet.\n\nThat script could be available via a web url and in that case, we can use wget or urllib to download it. Alternatively, the script could be available in Cloud Object Storage and in that case, we need to download it from COS.\n\nThe model should be represented as a zip file that consists of the python script and any other dependencies. For the current example, the model consists of a zip file that includes 2 python files, one is **convolutional_network.py** and the other is **input_data.py** which handles reading in the MNIST image data.",

To use HPO you must specify ranges of values to explore for each Hyperparameter.\n\nCurrently, two HPO algorithms are supported:\n- **random** implements a simple algorithm which will randomly assign Hyperparameter values from the ranges specified for an experiment.\n- **rbfopt** uses a technique called RBFOpt to explore the search space. RBFOpt is a Python library for black-box optimization (also known as derivative-free optimization). For more details, check the [user manual](https://github.com/coin-or/rbfopt/blob/master/manual.pdf)\n\nIn the configuration, we should select which algorithm to use for optimization (example below specifies **RBFOpt**), the objective to optimize (example below specifies **accuracy**), and the number of optimizer steps which sets an upper bound on the number of models which HPO will train (example below specifies **10**).\n\nNote that the **accuracy** metric needs to be a metric reported by the model. So in the convulional_network.py, there must be code that computes the **accuracy** metric or else HPO can't really optimize based on that metric as it needs to compare models based on that metric.\n\nThe second subsection in HPO configuration is the hyper parameters; need to specify which hyper parameters to vary and how to vary them. In the example below, we select the learning_rate, dropout, and batch_size as parameters to vary. \n\nNote again that these should be defined in the NN model as described in the script modeling that NN. \n\nFor more information on hyper parameter optimization:\nhttps://dataplatform.test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_hpo.html?context=wdp",

This method will stream training logs content to console.\n\nTip: You can also monitor particular training run by calling client.training.monitor_logs(training_run_uid). To get training_run_uid you can call method client.experiments.list_training_runs(experiment_run_uid)",

For this to work, you need to add your Watson Machine Learning to your Watson Studio project:\n- Navigate to your project's home\n- On your project page, click on the **Settings** tab.\n- On the **Settings** tab, scroll down to **Associated services** and click on  __Add service__ drop down (on the right side of the page) and select **Watson**.\n- This pops a window with all the Watson services including the Machine Learning service. Click the Add link in the Machine Learning service tile.\n- On the page that loads, select the __Existing__ tab and select the specific Machine Learning service where you ran your experiment.\n\nOnce you've associated the correct Watson Machine Learning service with your project, you can visualize the experiment results using the Experiment Assistant:\n- Navigate to your project's home\n- On your project page, click on the **Assets** tab.\n- Scroll down to **Experiments** and click on the name of the experiment you just ran.\n- This loads the Experiment Assistant which shows an  __Overview__ of the experiment, the associated __Training Runs__, and the experiment metrics with charts under __Compare Runs__ tab showing how the metrics change for the different runs.\n",
